I am an applied mathematician and algorithm developer with a long-standing focus on inverse problems, PDE-based modeling, optimization, and structure-exploiting numerical methods. I hold a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Brown University and have published more than 20 peer-reviewed articles spanning numerical analysis, inverse problems, regularization, and scientific computation.

My work emphasizes operator-aware formulations, adjoint methods, and fast, generalizable solvers—approaches that respect physical structure, stability, and well-posedness rather than relying on brute-force scale. I was trained to formulate inverse and optimization problems at the continuum level and to discretize as late as possible, so that adjoints and structural properties belong to the problem itself rather than to artifacts of a particular numerical scheme.

Earlier in my career, I worked as a software engineer in computational geometry and CAD (CAGD), developing mathematically sophisticated algorithms for geometric modeling. More recently, my work has focused on deploying structure-aware solvers in sensing and reconstruction settings, and on understanding how modern machine learning tools—unrolled networks, compact CNNs, physics-informed and operator-aware models—can be integrated responsibly around established numerical methods.

This GitHub reflects selective technical work and experiments rather than a full portfolio; much of my prior work appears in publications, reports, and deployed research codebases rather than public repositories.

Current interests include operator-aware models and objective functions, fast solvers for inverse problems and inverse design, and principled integration of learning with PDE-based computation.
