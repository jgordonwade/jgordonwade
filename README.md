With two decades of experience as an associate professor Mathematics and Statistics at Bowling Green State University, I have a passion for teaching, researching, and solving complex problems in mathematics. I hold a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from Brown University, and I have published over 20 peer-reviewed articles in various fields of mathematics, such as numerical analysis, inverse problems, optimization, and mathematical biology.

I have taught a wide range of mathematics and statistics courses at all levels, from remedial algebra to advanced graduate courses. Some of the topics I have covered include calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, optimization, discrete mathematics, probability theory, and actuarial mathematics. I have also served in numerous committees, including the Faculty Senate and the Assistant Chair of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics. I enjoy inspiring and mentoring students, collaborating with colleagues, and contributing to the advancement of mathematics

Before joining academia, I was a software engineer in CAGD. My love for developing and implementing mathematically sophisticated algorithms has never faded, and recently I have taken a keen interest in machine learning, neural networks, and distributed compuing.
